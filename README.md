# Record Home

An Experience Cloud component that allows for more customization than the OOTB Record Banner component.

The OOTB Record Banner is set using the Compact Layout of the object; the compact layout assignment is done by record type - we cannot change the compact layout in experience cloud without also changing the internal view for that record type.
This LWC lets us specify which fields to display instead of having to modify the compact layout of the record type for all users.
